The kids mother came running, but she was not upset, she was furious, and startled. She shouted, "Its the Murder!" she then shouted for the police, Midas stood still, as 5 police cars pulled up instantly, as they jumped out, guns armed, "Freeze", they shouted. "Midas Mu≈üki, You are under arrest, the Theraprism will come shortly." Midas then spoke, "Ahh, pathetic, my dear people, you are fools", "But I guess this is the entertainment I get." As he slams down his staff, and a dark cloud of smoke engulfs around his body, The cops begin fireing as his laugh cackles and echos as the smoke disappears. They stopped fireing, "Damnit!" Says the leader, The theraprism agents pull up, and the officer explains how Midas has gotten away. They look where Ford was, to see, he had disappeared... (Story Fades Away Mystically)
