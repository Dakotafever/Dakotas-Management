    <h4>1️⃣ How do you think of Devil's Roulette?</h4>
    <p>I think Devils Roulette is a great game with an amazing community. Although it's a little small community wise and game wise I still believe that one day it will grow and possibly surpass other top games.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>2️⃣ How can new players get better?</h4>
    <p>Getting better is learning strategy more than anything. Strategy is the biggest part of getting better because it provides you with a better chance to win — using your gadgets wisely and using the map gimmicks to your advantage.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>3️⃣ What do you wish to see in the future?</h4>
    <p>Honestly I would love to see in-game moderation and other high rank roles come to the game and implemented into the community. It would make the community much larger and get our Discord more active in my vision.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>4️⃣ Website Feedback</h4>
    <p>I haven't really seen your website so I have no comments.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Exotix</h3>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>1️⃣ How do you think of Devil's Roulette?</h4>
    <p>I think of Devil's Roulette as a hub to meet people in, on top of the pre-established Russian Roulette game. I always find myself meeting new people that always have something interesting to talk about while the game plays out.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>2️⃣ How can new players get better?</h4>
    <p>Learn how to read people’s body movements — subtle hand twitches, repeated glances, and behavior patterns. Understand how someone ticks. And learn to count the bullets.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>3️⃣ What do you wish to see in the future?</h4>
    <p>A physics-based butterfly knife trinket.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>4️⃣ Website Feedback</h4>
    <p>Besides checking for security vulnerabilities occasionally, the website seems fine.</p>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>1️⃣ How do you think of Devil’s Roulette?</h4>
    <p>I think Devil’s Roulette is going to be the next big game on Meta. It’s fun, exciting, intense, and doesn’t require much movement. A lot of the VR playerbase can’t play big games like Gorilla Tag or UG due to physical limitations or space issues. DR is a brilliant, more relaxed game — but it still keeps that fast-paced, intense mechanic.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>2️⃣ How can new players get better?</h4>
    <p>Count bullets. It has always helped, and it will never fail you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>3️⃣ What would you like to see added in the future?</h4>
    <p>In-game moderation. As moderators, we help manage the Discord, but we should also be able to help manage in-game lobbies with rude players and rule breakers. I’d also love to see icon skins for high-end Hotshots so we’re more recognized.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>4️⃣ Website Feedback</h4>
    <p>It’s already brilliant, Dakota. I genuinely can’t think of anything that could make it better.</p>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>1️⃣ How do you think of Devil's Roulette?</h4>
    <p>I honestly enjoy Devil's Roulette. I've been playing since the saloon and casino map so I've had a good time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>2️⃣ How can new players get better?</h4>
    <p>Go into random game sessions. It's easier to find games that way. Try different maps to get familiar and interact with the world. Also — just ask people things!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>3️⃣ What do you wish to see in the future?</h4>
    <p>New game modes, new strategies, community challenges, and big game events.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="birthday">🎉 Rex's Birthday is February 25th — Join the Discord to wish him a <highlight>Happy Birthday</highlight>!</p>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>🎮 Thoughts on Devil’s Roulette</h4>
    <p>I think DR is a great game for socializing with new people and for having fun and making funny moments with friends or randoms. The devs and CLs are really respectful and amazing, and the game as a whole is just incredible.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>🚀 What would you like to see added?</h4>
    <p>I’d love to see extra customization — like unlockable skin upgrades through challenges. For example, imagine a Pink Devil skin. After completing certain challenges, you unlock cosmetic upgrades like sunglasses or special effects. That kind of progression would be fire.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>🏆 Reaction to Becoming a Hotshot</h4>
    <p>7/10 at first because I didn’t even think it was real 😭 What really got me was my movie and interviews — the uniqueness and potential I showed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>🌐 Website Thoughts</h4>
    <p>I honestly couldn’t tell you — I haven’t viewed it in some time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>📈 Advice for New Players</h4>
    <p>Play with people who have 250+ wins. They’ll teach you when to use gears properly, how to dodge at the right time, and little tips and tricks. Whenever you see a 250+ player, ask them to run games.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>🎮 Thoughts on Devil’s Roulette</h4>
    <p>I think it has future top-tier potential on Meta Quest. It WILL be on par with Gorilla Tag, UG, and Animal Company — and I’m going to be here supporting it forever.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>🚀 What would you like to see added?</h4>
    <p>Two things: In-game moderation (since we deal with explicit players and can’t always act in-game) and Icon Skins for the top Hotshots so we’re more recognized.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>🏆 Reaction to Becoming a Hotshot</h4>
    <p>10/10. I was so happy but also proud of all the hard work paying off. It was honestly one of the best moments I’ve had in the server.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>🌐 Website Thoughts</h4>
    <p>If more people saw it, it would definitely grow. Your website is awesome!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa">
    <h4>📈 Advice for New Players</h4>
    <p>Count bullets. It ALWAYS helps. I’ve never had a game where I didn’t know what the last bullet was.</p>
  </div>
