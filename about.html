      <h2>About <highlight>𝕯𝖆𝓴𝖔𝖙𝖆</highlight></h2>
      <p>Hello Everyone! I hope yall love this project I managed to pulled off! This took alot of trouble shooting, bug testing, and alot of painful hours of making this website work and be 𝒫𝑒𝓇𝒻𝑒𝒸𝓉!</p>


      <h2>Special Thanks to all of the Wonderfull <strong>Community Leaders</strong> and below they have answered a few Questions!</h2>
      <p>𝐋oyle:</p>
      <p>𝓕𝓻𝓸𝔃𝓭𝔂:
     1)
     I think Devils Roulette is a great game with an amazing community. Although it's a little small community wise and game wise I still believe that one day it will grow and possibly surpass other top games. 

      2)
      Getting better is learning strategy more than anything. Strategy is the biggest part of getting better because it provides you with a better chance to win, using your gadgets wisely and using the map gimmicks to your advantage stuff like that. 

      3)
      Honestly I would love to see in game moderation and other high rank roles come to the game and implemented into the community. It would make the community much larger and get our discord mor active in my vision. 

      4)
      I haven't really seen your website so I have no comments. (Comment from Dakota: Bruh)</p>
      <p>Exotix: 1. I think of Devil's Roulette as a hub to meet people in, on top of the pre-established Russian Roulette game. I always find myself meeting new people that always have something interesting to talk about while the game plays out. The Discord server is the same - you meet people both young and old, new players who want advice on how to get better and old players that want to talk to like-minded people. It's a lot of fun.

       2. For new players, I'd reccomend learning how to read people's body movements - subtle hand twitches, repeatedly looking at someone, stuff like that. The more you understand how a person ticks, the easier it is to get in their head and think about how they might act. That, and learn to count the bullets.

       3. I've mentioned this in surveys in the past, but I'll bring it up again - give me a physics based butterfly knife trinket.

       4. Besides checking for security vulnerabilities occasionally, the website seems fine.</p>
      <p>Rex:<strong>>how you think of devil's roulette?</strong> - I honestly enjoy devil's roulette, and been playing it since the saloon and casino map so I've had a good time playing.

      <strong>how new players can get better?</strong> -Go into random game sessions. lobbies may get you a game once in a while but it's easier to do random sessions. If you do play in lobbies though, maybe try to play a certain map once in a while to get more familiar with it, and try to see if you can interact with the world. plus just ask people things!

      <strong>what you wish to see come to devils roulette in the future</strong> - I hope to see new game modes, new strategies and challenges from the community. Plus having big game events would be cool.</p>
      <p>Btw Rex's Birthday is on the 25 (February) So join the Discord to wish him a <highlight>Happy Birthday</highlight>!</p>
